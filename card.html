				<p>
					Aye-aye is an endangered species of lemur native to Madagascar where
					many of the locals believe the animal to be magical. They are seen as
					harbringers of evil and often killed on sight and hung up so that the
					evil spirit will be carried away by travelers. Aye-ayes have a distinct
					long narrow middle finger that they use to forage for grubs from within
					trees after they gnaw trough the bark.
